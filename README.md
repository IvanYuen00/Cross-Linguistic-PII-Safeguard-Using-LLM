# Bilingual PII Extraction with LLM

This project is designed to extract Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from text in both English and Traditional Chinese using pre-trained models. It leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and analyze text data effectively.

## Features

- Extracts PII from English text.
- Identifies named entities in Traditional Chinese.
- Handles bilingual text seamlessly.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher) along with the following libraries:
